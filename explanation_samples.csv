<li>8) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IDYRZ0S"" target=""_blank""><em>B00IDYRZ0S</em></a>: so much to like but issue last month i review case logic dsb split pack backpack i love it but now see some limitation with ithere is my review of the dsb case logic know how to make case i do not think i have ever given one of their case less than stars recently i have review other camera backpack and gadget bags and this tops all of them i review the lowepro fast pack w and the amazon basics large dslr bag this blow both of them out of the this is a combo bag and pack unlike the lowepro which has a separate space under it that is side load this separate case at the bottom is top load just like a gadget bag this ensure that the camera do not fall out and it is not awkward get to the gear unzip the top of the bag and you have access to a roomy gadget bag it also has a curve support so the camera with lens attach do not rest on the bottom you have to put this pack down on the ground table or other support to access the bottom compartment as the top hinge off you will want the support as with any good size bag but i suppose one could just swing the bag around while it is on the body and get out the gearthe top compartment can store personal item as there is so much room in in the bottom gear bag to store lot of equipment the front pocket can fit an ipad and possibly a netbook or mac airi recently took this on an airplane and it fit well under the seat case logic tend to make their roomy bags with a more narrow and compact design than lowepro i really appreciate get rid of the bulk as a woman the strap do not cut into my underarm as some backpack do they are curve so this do not happen at lbs without gear it do get a little heavy but the chest strap and waist strap alleviate some of the weight this is a car trip or air trip bag for me not a hike photo pack as it do weigh plus pound recent trip had the following contentsin the bottom sectiona d with mm and reverse hood attach in the middle a lens and my new sony attach smartphone lens on the right side a sensor dust blower various charger a canon close up lens on the left side i could have add my hoodman loupe and speedlight flash too each side had a soft cushion attach cover to prevent the gear from fall outexcept if you turn it over as they do not have any closure strap the bag has three slot for sd cards but my second sony battery which is slim fit in one slot under the top compartment is a velcro pocket for my plastic rain lens cover and microfiber clothsthe top charger cell phone in an inside pocket nikon battery pen highlight small notepad prs of glasses snack business card case and it was not even half full very easy to access and find things too with two interior pocket that zipthe front pocket store my ipad air the kensington keyboard for it a magazine and my billfold plus travel docsi did not carry a tripod but it has strap with rubber that hold the tripod close to the side of the packthe back of the pack is well pad to protect the camera and the user backthe other side of the case has a pouch that has the rain pouch for the pack it attach to a velcro tether so it cannot be drop easily and lostthe only pouch the case do not have is one for a water bottle i can only surmise that case logic do not want us to spill any water and ruin our geari see lot of action for this highly recommend gear back packi repeat this review because the pocket are somewhat similar especially the main compartment while the pack are similar the one in this review is a sling and dsb is a back pack i will comment on this last as it is the main reason i knock off a starthi pack compartment are superior to the dsb there are more compartment they make better sense for a photographer gear and accessory there is a slim pocket for phone pen papers and wallet on the side are two stack pocket for filter and other accessory every pocket has some padding also on the side is the compartment for a dslr my dslr a d had an lens attach and it fit easily this compartment is similar to the dsb split pack but in a better locationthe top compartment rather than being one deep one is two small one stack again this make better sense for organize my charger went in the top one with key in the a zipper pocket the large one fit a pouch of extra battery and other accessory that i call my photo to go packthe rain bonnet for the bag is one the bottom where most other pack have them the dsb was on the side not really a show stopper either way just make more sensewhat i really like about this pack is that it do not split a common new feature with photo bags because it do not split it has a full pocket in back for an ipad or laptop this is what i have been wanting in all of the other pack i review i also like that the main dslr compartment is on the side easy to access at all timesso in wrapping up all of the pocket were superior to the dsb but yet i deduct a star they made this pack a sling but with two strap at about plus pound without my gear and a whopping lbs with my gear i as a woman cannot carry it as a sling it is way too heavy so they did include another strap to convert it to a backpack the problem here is that the sling is wide than the second strap and more substantial because of this uneven i cannot walk long distance with this pack the wide strap digs into my underarm the dsb as a backpack with waist strap and a chest strap take the weight offnow if case logic could design this bag as a backpack they would have the perfect bag</li>

second analog a bit limited without the clamshell lidthe ds was release two years ago and is only just recently reach its potential ive had mine for a year at this point and i can definitely say that ive notice the number of people i encounter through streetpass skyrocket in the past few month i use to be able to walk down the street without pick up anyone at all in fact i went through the london underground in rush hour and only had five hit but now i walk down through my fairly small town and i pick up ten new people every time its made it almost tooo easythe reason for this surge in popularity is obvious the ds was mar by a rather dismal set of release games that was dominate by port from the n and ps such asthe legend of zelda ocarina of fox of the abyss it was the same way for the first year and a half as everyone try to figure out what to do with it with the strange d features and motion control putt some developer off fortunately the system got over that and now has its own unique games emblem link between world xas to the ds in general the system is basically the same as the ds with improve graphics why improve on perfection i suppose that machine was a nearperfect game platform with many classic games the graphics however were often quite blocky and sometimes ugly the ds improve on that although most games keep the unrealistic style of ds games they just do it better with cartoony graphics that actually look like cartoon some of the visual on the ds can be pretty amazing but there are few games that show them off to the full i think that the graphics level is somewhere around that of the ps as can be seen in a number of direct ps port this is good enough for a handheld system and means we can finally get rid of the blocky little shrunken men that dominate ds games its not as good as but since ds games are rarely about superior graphics that doesnt matter most of the best ds games would have work just fine on the ds they simply look nice with better graphics and that sum up nintendo strategy to a t if it aint broke dont fix it and since the ds can do ds games better than the ds as well as play higher end games ace combat look pretty good on its screen this system offer a lot more chance for expansion while allow nintendo to take few aspect of the hardware that get people a bit upset is the battery life the ds cant really play a ds game for long than hour putt it well below the operate time of the original ds and even the vita however that only for ds games the system can run on battery for eight or more hour when play ds games which isnt really any worse than the ds itself the reduce battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics there is no way around it the one batteryrelate thing that do bother me though is that the sleep mode isnt very good at conserve energy if you leave the ds sleep for two days without a charge it will run out of battery i assume this is related to streetpass and could be resolve by simply turning the wifi off so im give it a break on that scorethe ds come with with a number of program preinstall including system setting the eshop activity log nintendo zone d camera and mii maker these program are fairly selfexplanitory and cannot be delete as they are essential to the function of the system im not particularly happy with the estore it seem rather clunky to use and crash frequent its nice that it can background download but it make everything up to that point far too difficult the ds can play downloade games rather than use cartridge and the fact that it use standard memory cards means that this isnt that difficult or expensive to do a major plus over the vita and its memory cardsalso preinstall are face raider and augment reality these are both short games design to be use with the dss camera they add digital create figures to what appear behind your ds and allow you to for example shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls its pretty cool and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since the other game on there is streetpass this is a collection of two games though they can be upp to six if you pay for them that depend on you collect other player character via wifi as you pass another ds in the street you will automatic sync with it and their character will show up on your mii plaza from which you can play games i dont know of any other system that has social game features that make you feel as involved as this i understand that japan has something similar with cell phone games and i believe there was something like it for the psp but over here the only competition is vita near and streetpass leaves near in the dust there just no benefit to use near whereas with streetpass you get to play games with people you run into even if theyre not involved any more than that rewards include hat and uniform for your mii major problem with the ds when compare to its predecessor is that games are now regionlocke europe games cannot be play on america system nor can japan games this is a real problem for me as i have a europe ds so at the moment i cant play games iv though i suspect that theyll release it in europe eventually fortunately the ds cartridge are still regionfree and can be play in any systemthe ds come in three version model ds and the ds this one now the ds is fine as a system but its screen is just as tiny as the dss the dsxl however has a screen that almost twice as big while still fitting comfortable in your hand or your pocket it also has a long battery life give you perhaps an extra hour usage even if you only want to use it to play ds games its worth the upgrade it is of course the most expensive of the three option the ds is somewhat cheap and fit in pocket easy but i personally dont like how boxy it is the dsxl is all smooth lines and is only slightly big when you consider the increase size of the screen but if small size really is important for you id go with the ds the ds is really only for people who dont expect to carry it around in their pocket the onepiece construction make it strong but it do mean that it is less protect and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in the fact that it doesnt have d isnt much of a loss but the low price can be a real gain i have friends who swear by the ds and i can see its advantage but if you expect to bring it everywhere id go for one of the other two option given the option id go for the dsxl but there are advantage to all three modelsto sum up the ds is an excellent game system that improve on what didnt work on the ds while keeping all of the features that work the lack of a clamshell lid is a bit of a nuisance but the system itself is sturdy and not as easy to damage as might be thought anyone wanting a portable game system has no reason not to turn to the ds i was never a fan of portable games since i came to them back in the days of gameboy and

<li>3) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00834SJNA"" target=""_blank""><em>B00834SJNA</em></a>: broke within two week i can understand all the positive review of this product if nothing go wrong then its a pretty spiffy hard drive but im at a loss to explain the lack of negative review surely im not the first person to have a problem especially since some of the problem are inherent in the design specifically the usb cable which is too long and fit loose into my computer usb jack it give it a loose connection and is generally easy to knock out and in what appear to be an unrelated problem my hard drive start random disconnect after only a week and a half only to disconnect permanent after two week im not sure if ill have to break the case which has no screw hole to allow such an obvious thing in order to get at the hard drive or if all my data is lost for good and i need that data this isnt my first external not by a long shot ive use wd up till now and only got this one because of the price and good review but ive never had a problem with any of them up till the problem seem to have been in the hard drive mount something was wrong with the connection there and it got worse over time somehow this manage to fragment my hard drive into tiny little pieces and corrupt all of my data ive upgrade this review to two stars solely because of seagate superb friendly customer support which respond to my complaint without hesitation they even allow me to break open my case to try and recover my data unfortunately this doesnt get them more than an extra star since they then proceed to bungle my order whether because they dont replace externals or just because they screw up they sent me a new internal hard drive which leaves me rely on the one piece of hardware that i know doesnt work in a case that design to break when s forced open since i no long have time to sort this out through them i gave up and bought myself a new external case ive spent well over half the money i paid for this thing in repair recovery fail shipping and a new case so yes despite their friendly service this hard drive was still a colossal waste of my time and money</li>
<li>4) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006T7QSVS"" target=""_blank""><em>B006T7QSVS</em></a>: a really good deal i havent really had time to wear this one in but here are my initial thought thus far this camera is amazing for what i paid the price seem to have gone up since then but its still an extraordinary deal this approach slr quality yet is cheap than even a basic slr it should be noted though that this is basically the same camera as thefujifilm finepix that that one take aa battery while this one has its own brand also the sdhc card on this one isnt located in the same compartment as the battery so every time you change the card the camera doesnt turn itself off i really hate that spacesave feature on a lot of camera these daysim coming onto this from afujifilm finepix jz which was nice except that i wore out the rubber on the zoom lens through overuse i can tell i wont have that problem on this one since the lens doesnt move in and out every time i turn on the camera in fact the zoom lens is adjust mechanical by twist it a must for me since it allow for greater control and accuracy this camera has a x lens which allow for incredible closeup its basically like have binoculars hooked up to the front of your camera i was able to zoom in and make out a hawk in the distance that i just plain couldnt see with my own eyes this incredible zoom just make it all the more unforgivable that the camera has a plastic tripod screw how on earth can you make a camera with a x zoom and not expect people to use it with a tripodthi isnt an slr but its close the lens is built in and unchangeable but its good enough that only real pro would need a different one it even has decent macro setting the setting do take a little fiddling with to get them to work right the manual isnt particularly helpful in this regard but the automatic mode exr is pretty basic to use and do a good job of determine the proper setting to take the best picture once you figure out how to use it manual mode works very well change the aperture and the shutter speed is pretty simple and there is a manual focus dial that make it quite easy to use the iso and aperture are adjust though a dial next to the mode dial while the focus is on the lens itself only complaint here is that the viewscreen doesnt show you the picture youll actually take but just the view out of the lens that means itll take a lot of practice to get good shot out of this fortunately it take pictures really quick so you can try quite a lot of things in a short period of timethere are nine other mode to chose from but those are the only two i really bother with panorama mode is really cool when it works which it usually doesnt have the gyroscope on is essential for this it is rather more successful when recording a less than view i may get more use from this mode when i actually go somewhere worth get a panoramic view of but for now its just a waste i have a panoramic app on my iphone that a lot less finicky another mode take d pic which seem cool but is just sort of gimmicky also there are two mode which are basically half of manual mode one of which has auto aperture but manual shutter speed and the other mode has the inverse apart from these youre better off just stick to automatic surprising the video mode isnt located on the dial but has its own dedicated button this allow you to take photo while youre use the video camera pretty cool it record in p which is bluray quality video it all looks pretty good only thing is that it only record video for minutes at a time so if youre thinking this can replace a dedicated video camera then youre gonna be disappointed no i dont know why it wont record an even it just doesntso that i like about this camera it has a gyroscope that help you keep the camera level which is very useful for horizon shot it flip vertical when you turn the camera on its side there an antiblur feature which is useful but rarely seem to do much its a bit hard to tell whether its working like all fujifilm camera nowadays it features facial recognition software which works quite well unless there are multiple or occasional no face in shot there are usb and hdmi output hidden under a panel in the side which are useful for display your photo over a tv or computer the other side hold the memory card and the battery in two separate compartment ive heard people have problem with the flash but that hasnt happen to mine yet it do need to be manual open and one of the more annoy features of silent mode is that it turn the flash off too it do feature a slot on the top for an external flash which may be useful as the built in one isnt very impressive i like have a viewfinder that i can look down but i wish it stuck out since my nose keeps rubbing against the main viewscreen there is a light sensor next to the viewfinder that determine whether youre look through that or use the main screen it tend to switch back and forth whenever you move your hand so i just set it to stick on one or the other the viewscreen has a pretty awesome feature that let you pop it out so that you can see it while holding the camera at an angle this hasnt come in useful yet but im sure itll come in handy later if you ever need to shoot over something this feature will be a lifesaver the camera come with a reasonably good strap but not with a case at least mine didnt youre gonna want to get one as when you have the strap around your neck the camera knock back and forth against its of the minor problem are pretty minor there is no way to charge the battery without remove it or to plug the camera in and use it though a wall outlet some of the control are hard to figure out the zoom is so powerful that you can easily zoom too far and get blurry photo if you dont watch out and as previous mention the tripod screw is made of plastic and will not last but aside from that its a really excellent device ill be update this over time as i get a better feel for its capabilities but thus far ive had no problem a good buy</li>
<li>5) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035JD0C8"" target=""_blank""><em>B0035JD0C8</em></a>: good but doesnt last i really like this camera but it just didnt last like it should have after about a month it develop a dead pixel on the viewscreen within three month half the screen had gone black making it difficult to see exactly what the picture looks like after about a year the rubber came off the lens im not sure precisely how long it will continue to function after this perhaps the damage is mostly cosmetic but i feel like the camera is on its last leg ill use it till it go for good but it really shouldnt be fall apart yet i took good care of it and kept it in a nice case secure from physical damage certainly i use it a lot but not enough for this and the screen damage start before i had really gotten the chance to do more than just try it out perhaps i simply got a defective one but that just means that if you get this be sure to watch careful for any problem before the warranty expire one dead pixel isnt a problem but a few hundred isa for the camera itself its decent enough i really like it until it start to fall apart even then i was able to take my pictures no problem as some people have notice it doesnt take very good lowlight pictures they tend to come out very grainy nonetheless when i learned how to use it i took some quite exceptional nighttime shot of illuminate building at night i even manage to use the zoom while prop myself against a wall ie no tripod and the pictures came out perfect i think that a lot of the negative criticism of the camera overstate the case while the lowlight shot were grainy they were rarely terrible if mediocre indoor functional of a camera is a dealbreaker then this may be a camera to avoid but otherwise it isnt a major problem i took most of my photo during the day in any event and they came out beautiful no grain at all and very crispthe battery life is alright i wish that camera like this could just take aa battery when your main one die but i guess that that isnt gonna happen i end up buy a spare battery and even being an atrocious shutterbug the two battery last me all day im not that familiar with digital camera my last camera was a mm slr so i cant say whether that good or not all that i know is that it was adequate for my needs the only time i had a problem was when i accidental left my charger at home while i was in the middle of the jordan desert i actually had more of a problem with the sdhc cards the gb one that the camera come with just doesnt cut it you are go to need to buy a big one at some pointyou can actually do a surprising amount with this camera for just a simple pointandshoot the zoom is amazing for its size i dont think that any of the model of comparable price can compete with a x zoom the various setting take a little while to figure out but once you get them sort you can take very good pic obviously this cant compete with a more advanced camera but then few of those can fit in your pocket and none of them are cheap all in all this isnt a bad camera for basic shot provided that you get one that isnt defective if mine hadnt fallen apart id have undoubted given it five stars</li>",Nintendo 3DS XL - Blue/Black [Old Model] Games Included,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FMjaFKYNL.jpg,"<li>WiFi Built In: Yes</li>

<li>6) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006PWGESY"" target=""_blank""><em>B006PWGESY</em></a>: fit well has an elastic band to aid with the hand strap just got it and it fit very well and the use of the elastic band to hold the tablet with use with the hand strap was especially useful which is a major design flaw with the roocase the one issue that i did encounter was that the power and volume buttons are hard not impossible to access you will need to do it with your nail given the symmetry where the two buttons are placed on top on either side it might have been better to have a small wedge around those buttons made it aesthetic and functional at the same time i hope the folks that design it actually fit it on a tablet and verify its use before the finalize the design i dock one star simply for that the material and stitch looks very good and classy</li>

pass i am not sure i am okay with such a hitormiss situation thoughi have submit a issue to synology and will we look forward to their feedback until then dock one more staroriginal reviewthi is my first experience with a nas i do a lot of photography and my wife do home video and with camera my year old has one too it was becoming a serious issue with organize all the pictures and video my first setup was an external harddrive that was connected to a pc that had a dlna server the problem was that it was too slow the computer had to be always on and i had no backup add to it one of my other old harddrive broke down and that got me thinking a raid setup seem ideal in my case and while cheap option are available userexperience and reliability is very important to me note that raid is not a backup setup data is only mirror and hence allow for failure recovery more about this in a are the nas i hard to find because it is synology latest with a ghz floating point process and mb of ramd the one i eventually bought witha ghz process and mb of from qnap with a ghz process and mb from qnap with a ghz process and gb ramnote that ds ts and ts all share a common marvell process the dsj is a different process architecture with higher l cache capability to issue instruction under most circumstances and capability to handle a fast ddr ram i am not go into which one is a better process between ds and dsj but my sense is that the difference would not be chose the ds because i was in a hurry to get this setup and ds had things that were important to me usb port and an sd card reader that said if you can find the dsj and you are new to a nas environment you wont be disappointed especially with all the review i have readback to the ds i also bought two tb westerndigital red hard drive setup was very easy although the instruction that came with it did not include ds i was surprise but it did not matter because there is enough resources online to make sure i did not screw up on step which was to pull the enclosure out insert the hard drive connect it to a network port and turn in on it is as simple as that type from a browse and it find the system it walk you thro a menu of setting up the hard drive i specifically chose a raid setup not the hybrid raid mechanism not that i had anything against it just knew i want a raid setup the hard drive were format and was ready to be use the entire setup did not take more than minutesthe nas was connected in the basement thro a switch the route itself supporta a gigabit lan the speed from my laptop wireless to the nas was about mbp i swap out the switch with a trendnet gigabit switch and wire my laptop directly thro the route a mb file now only took about seconds i am not sure if they were other bottle neck but this speed is more than sufficient for all my worki then install my tb harddrive and pushed all the data into my nas the data from the nas can also be back up to a external device which i have not setup yet but is very easy to do this will be a real backup if the nas were ever to fail now i have a way protection of my datathere are lot of app to be install i have only install the media server and here is the first time i ran into an issue setup is relatively easy but synology os insist that it create thumbnail of all your pictures if you setup a folder for photo the problem is it keep do it for over days and was barely at i found some resources on the web and figured out a way to minimize it and it work successful here is a link that will help make sure you back up all the file you are entire ui feel like use a window os and i mean that in a good way there are lot of option and very thing is done with emphasis on security in other words nothing is on by default while this means that it take a few steps to get a map drive on your machine it feel better that wayoverall i have been very impress with it in the one week i have use it i dock one star for the thumbnail booboo that synology did the intent is good but force it seem wrong if force it at least provide better easy to configure option than have to backdoor iti will update this review as i use this more and i can only say i have had a very positive experience until nowone more word on the hard drive enterprise type hard drive have great mtbf with a usage but are very costly desktop hard drive are meant for lower usage about hour a day the wdred appear to be a good compromise between the two in the sense that it is design specifically with a nas in mind</li>

<li>2) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001K6XYWY"" target=""_blank""><em>B001K6XYWY</em></a>: great value if you are look for silence in a fan this is probably the biggest bang for your buck youll find there are better perform or slightly quiet fan but youll end up pay or times as much and the performance isnt or times better i always use gelid silent series fan for system i know wont be overclocke they provide more then enough air flow and you cant hear them at lower rpm if you have them at you can start to hear them but rarely if ever will you need to have your fan go full speedif youre look for a well price quality fan here it is</li>
<li>3) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EYV690"" target=""_blank""><em>B001EYV690</em></a>: good modular psu for the price this psu is semimodular meaning that the component everybody is go to use are not modular like the pin but things like sata and pci connect are modular some of the cable can be a little short but in a small form factor pc this is a plus rather then a minus my biggest complaint is that the component that are not modular are a pin motherboard connect a pin motherboard connect and an pin motherboard connect why they didnt just do one pin like most semimodular psu is beyond me this essentially forces you to have one cable you are go to have to hide somewhere which somewhat defeat the purpose of a modular power supply so just to be clear i have no problem with a semimodular power supply if you want to pay a bit more fur a fully modular then do so my issue is with how they did the semimodular connect but if finding room for one extra cable is not an issue then this end up not being that big of a deal</li>
<li>4) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058UUR6E"" target=""_blank""><em>B0058UUR6E</em></a>: great asu quality other review warn of problem with the colors out of the box i was use the hdmi port and while they were slightly off as soon as i change the setting to one that fit my environment theater look best for me it was excellent i had considered other monitor for about the same price at place like costco etc but i always seem to have problem with dead pixel in the past not this time it is also a very sleek design and looks greati do feel i need to point out that this is not a display it is actually but unless you are really meticulous you would never notice the difference asu do sell a true version if you are dead set on that extra but you will end up pay more for it not worth it to me</li>
<li>5) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RJJMBI"" target=""_blank""><em>B004RJJMBI</em></a>: great for a certain grip type before you buy this take a look at your hand on your mouse if the palm of your hand is rest on your mouse this is probably not the mouse for you if you have large hand you probably only touch the mouse with your fingertip and thumb for the most part if this is you you will have no problem with the claw grip it may take a few minutes to get use to the feel of it but that is true with all mice</li>

that will not work on any of my computer are window bit the other is an old dinosaur laptop window bit problem is i download the software and it instruct me to pleae plug in my device i do and it never recognize the headset worse is sloooow response from customer service and so far just canned response at best with no solution just be advisedi am retired disabled and have pretty bad hearing loss thanks to my fun in the usmc war years of riding loud motorcycle wife scream at me to turn off that blank computer or game console etc i have to remove my hearing aids to wear headset or you lose all sense of direction so it would make any attempt at surround sound meaningless for myself a headset really has to perform and offer up some honest performance to even be usablethi is why only my astro a wireless headset ever live up to any use at all when i factor in the above mixed in with comfort long term use etc i game often for hour a day if in a lot of pain use it as a distraction to keep off pain medication the other reason i love my astro set is they work across all game platform and work as well for anything else any headset duty require expensive but they carry their weight and as to weight they are light of course that is due to what is also their weak link their battery is on a controller that essentially render then total non wirelessthi is where this wonderful headset by steelsery shine no wire you pay for that luxury in headset weight but they got smart use a very small light cell phone style battery and brilliant add a second backup battery in the component that you connect to your game source use a supply optical cable and speak of cable unlike my astro set this came with every possible cable connection you will ever use this is a really big deal for me since being disabled i get pissed when i open any item i purchase to find i need to get to a store somehow to purchase something else to get it to workthere are days sometimes week i am unable to leave a bed or chair so for some of us it really is a big deali own every console made now except the xbox one i will get that later in this year at the moment i prefer my old xbox now on my ps i still have unfinished games but bought the new ps and love some new features it offer with this new headset you can use included game chat feature with just the optical cable they include for surround sound for our old generation console you guess it they include that cable for you as well i will try to list my favorite features my least favoritei love that actually do a better job of letting my damage hearing actually hear sound and actual direction and noticeable better than my asto a set i own headset now and nobody succeed at this till now this for me is cable you ever need are includedwork across all platform from my apple pc all generation game consolesi have yet to even look at any instruction this is so simple and intuitive i had it unboxed and was play on my ps in under minutes unheard mild if any lag for me on games this week on pc old xbox old ps and new ps gamesno damn wire the pull out mike like on my new steelsery siberia elite headset with dolby surround sound sound field on the fly while huge asset for gamingso close buti wear glasses and after several hour have to keep adjust the headset for comfort a bit no big deal however i suspect they will smooth out a bit with a tad heavy but the amazing performance more than make up for itthat it no other complaint ask my wife and she will tell you i am the old geezer she know and assume it is from from all the pain i live ini admit i am miserable most the time so it honestly is hard for me to like anything these days i love this headset so much so i just put my astro a headset up for sale on craigslist here in san diego now that speak volumes if you knew me even a little the only reason for the overall star rating instead of stars is due to quality control issue over the past years with this brand i hope this set will hold up better if it do in a year or more i will raise it to stars but i need to make sure the prior set i got burn on doesnt return make no mistake these are the best sound game headset i ever own yes you pay for it if you pay full list but that is even a bargain compare to what i paid for my astro and they didnt even include all i need so i break these down as quality starscomfort stars for my head yours may be better or completewith all you need starsuser score starsi am round down to stars instead of up only due to my past quality control issue this set seem to be rock solid and very well construct but it has to earn my trust after my past experience my personal opinion is that if you ever see these for sale at under jump all over them they are a wonderful game headset i may be grumpy like the wife say but i know happiness when i feel itthese make me feel it</li>

<li>2) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D741DRK"" target=""_blank""><em>B00D741DRK</em></a>: a little pricy but stylish and cool this headphone stand has a simple zigzag design but its a really fun way to store your largesize headphone although it claim to be a stand for all headphone size it doesnt work well with bose headphone which are much slim than beat for beat and similar such headphone however its a perfect fit and great display stand for when your phone arent in use it doesnt take up much space and add some style to any room recommend</li>

<li>6) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQZQPNM"" target=""_blank""><em>B00DQZQPNM</em></a>: good in standing position only i was extremely excited to use this case but im sad to say that i find it virtually unusable the huge thing that it has go for it is that like the official amazon case it locks the kindle into place rather than strapping it in or slide it into a sleeve for that i give it a bonus star unfortunately everything else is a disappointment here my run downpro lockin case standing feature works okay sturdy cover good quality materialcon stand works but is kinda iffy im constant worried it will fall horrible to hold when not in standing position the back flap wave around maddening and is a nuisance you will not be able to read on your hd with this case because it is so difficult to hold with that flap flop about games are also hard to play with this case due to the same unsteady grip i repeat unless your kindle is stationary in the sittingstand position you will go insane the case do not appear to be meant to be held in one handoverall while i like the material and feature instead of the slidein or strapin variety i almost immediately remove this case from my fire because it was so difficult to juggle when in my hand i occasional want my kindle prop up but most of the time im holding it for me this case is virtually useless not recommend</li>
<li>7) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQZQCUI"" target=""_blank""><em>B00DQZQCUI</em></a>: slim fit niceish quality im happy the material has a cheap feel but the sleek black design doesnt necessarily announce to the world that its a bargain case there also a few things i prefer about it compare to similar are my pro lightweight goodenough protection magnet flap standing feature works well slim fit nonintrusive comfortable to hold much cheap than official case by amazonoverall if you dont mind have a cheaplooke borderline tacky case for your fire hd this case is practical and effective about the only thing it doesnt do is automatic put your fire to sleep like the amazon case do for a third of the price however one cannot complain too much</li>
<li>8) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQZQHBW"" target=""_blank""><em>B00DQZQHBW</em></a>: i would choose black over green but overall i like it ill be honest the material use for this case both looks and feel cheap the green is especially tacky i have the black as well and it looks more professional nonetheless this case do the job that its supposed to do and do have several perk go for ithere are my pro lightweight goodenough protection magnet flap standing feature works well slim fit nonintrusive comfortable to hold much cheap than official case by amazonoverall if you dont mind have a cheaplooke borderline tacky case for your hd this case is practical and effective about the only thing it doesnt do is automatic put your fire to sleep like the amazon case do for a third of the price however one cannot complain too much</li>
<li>9) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4FCHH4"" target=""_blank""><em>B00G4FCHH4</em></a>: luxurious texture great material but im not crazy about it pro has a new car smell velvety smooth texture that is fun to touch chic elegant design keeps kindle firm in place provide adequate protectioncon awkward to hold while reading thick than other case large brand label that protrude on both side of the cover and in the center of the case one proud states that the case was design in finland produce in china a little difficult to get the kindle into place and center the first time mine has some kind of glue fleck on the cover that are very itchy ruin the soft touch feel ive been try to get rid of them but its difficult as they seem to be embed into the materialoverall im compare this kindle case with the kindle paperwhite leather coverwhich is current the same price and this golla cover doesnt hold a candle to the official one amazon case is ultra slim light weight automatic put your kindle to sleep and fit snug without annoy stretchy band and is a joy to read with although i like the texture of this case especially if it didnt have those glue fleck all over it its still not user friendly in my opinion a step above belkin and many other offbrand cover but if youre go to spend big buck on a case get the official one from amazon its by far the best</li>
<li>10) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DEQK9VC"" target=""_blank""><em>B00DEQK9VC</em></a>: extra camera for qsee system if youre look at this list you probably already have a sdi dvr system and maybe just want an extra camera or upgrade to the p camera in any case it should be noted that this will not work on its own so if youre look to save a few buck sorry you have to buy the whole systemi think the advantage of a qsee system is that it is really user friendly for anyone its very convenient for domestic or business surveillance i was able to get it go myself use channel p sdi surveillance dvr system with hd p camera and preinstall tb hard drive greyand im by no means a techie if youre wiring a business or have a house huge enough to need camera i would definitely hire somebody to help you install everything but other wise anybody can do ita far as the camera itself is concerned im very impress the picture isnt planet earth quality but its darn good especially for a simple security camera the night vision is also more than impressive and can see distant range at night as well as close up i live in a rural area where it is not surprising to see a deer or turkey strut by and ive caught some nice footage of critter no burglar yet but that a good thingoverall a little pricey but a very impressive security camera that is easy to set up and start rolling i give it a solid recommendation</li>","Heininger 5400 GarageMate Black Microfiber Towel, (Pack of 10)",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9180iFnAI7L._AC_SX466_.jpg,"<li>Absorbs 7 times their weight in liquid</li>

<li>8) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FFJ0HUE"" target=""_blank""><em>B00FFJ0HUE</em></a>: outstanding potential update useless power button update someone suggest i update the bio from asu so i did and the power button is much better now why it wasnt like this from the start i dont know but back too my original stars this thing is nice but a tad quirky but im connected to my tv via miracast now and its pretty cool such is the way of new toy sometimes not all the kink have been work outupdate reduce rating to stars because the power button is very problematic cant get it to turn the pc on of the time may have to call asu about a repair its a simple concept if you cant turn it on then its useless in fact as i type this i realize i have to just give it star shame as this had so much to the original is really measure up to be a great laptop ive been a fan since the motherboard days and am really start to like them over toshiba as my goto laptop brand i have anasu avdah and am quite impress with it because its got a lot of punch and is one of the few economical laptop out there that still has a physical graphics card this transformer book cant hold a match to that but for a budget tabletlaptop its pretty amazing unfortunately its got a lot of hiccup tooi it a tablet or a that the coolest thing about this little guy its a fullfledge touchscreen laptop that detach from the keyboard to transform into a tablet cool to say the least the footprint is basically x and about thick with the keyboard attach to detach and use in tablet mode just push the lock button on the keyboard and remove the screen voila instant tablet the screen reattache quite easily and locks into place so i can literally pick up the whole thing by the screen if i want and the parts stay secure attach the build feel rock solid it doesnt feel like itll break apart accidental and the parts lock together and feel like one solid unit when attach very to window in its natural most people i wasnt all that fond of window when i first try it its not that the os is bad or anything its just a big departure from the window we use to know plus window was design to be touched so unless youre use it on a touchscreen laptop then its just cumbersome and awkward i end up tweak win on my main asu laptop to run more like win and im much happy with it that way on that particular computer nontouchscreen but on this transformer book window is kinda dreamy im really fall in love with it within this context on a touchscreen device where it was made to shine window was meant to be swipe and touched not click to death with a mouse or touchpad frankly microsoft shot themselves in the foot with that one a touchscreen device should have been mandatory for window and that os should never be install on a nontouchscreen device its just not meant to be use that way my opinion of win has improve fold now that i finally see it in action the way it was meant to be use all this transformer book is very attractive sleek chic and modern the downside though is it attract fingerprint like crazy the high gloss lid is beautiful so long as you never touch it but the minute you lay finger on it it show every smear and smudge and quick looks like crap the touchscreen is no better i have a new kindle hdx and i dont know what amazon did to that thing but no matter how many times i poke and touch it im hard pressed to find any fingerprint on the thing i mean i really have to try hard to make a single smudge or smear this transformer converse could pick up fingerprint from an imaginary friend the screen on my friends ipad always looks like that too and i never want to touch it because of that i turn into in that moment inspect every smear and smudge imagine these touchscreen to be breeding grounds for every virus and infection known to man not a very attractive feature of this otherwise beautiful laptop im constant wipe this thing down even after just a few minutes use its just that badthe netbook those little netbook that were virtually useless for anything but check email well that what this remind me of only this time its actually useful this is a fullfledge window experience here not a glorify email device so in that regard you can do anything on this transformer book that you can do on a regular laptop well almost it has no disk drive so youre limited to downloadable software only no one gonna load adobe production suite onto this thing but a cloud version of photoshop might be base that the direction were all head microsoft office has already gone there and the os is soon to follow in the not too distant future software piracy will become near obsolete since everything will be base in the cloud including our own document but the upside to that is it should cut down on virus piracy and the dread system wipe and reinstall that weve all had to suffer through on office except publisher from what i can tell come with a user license product key in the boxusb recovery diskthi come with a usb flash drive in the box its very nice and chic look but i cant get any of my computer to recognize or read it im assume its a recovery disk in case the computer ever be standard android or apple tablet is very easy to use nary a software update or any real knowledge require this transformer book is great since you get the best of both world tablet and laptop but just dont become complacent thinking youre use a run of the mill tablet its not this is a fullfledge window pc that can be use like a tablet but its still window in all its glory and with all its security concern too be sure to install a good antiviru or security suite and keep it update dont fool yourself into believe youre use an innocent little tablet i like have the full throttle power of a window machine in tablet form i just gotta remind myself to remember that its a full window experience and not just a glorify toy like other tabsthe hiccup as this laptop is there are some serious hiccup that make it feel more like a work in progress than a fully realize idea here they are wonky power button sometimes i just cant get it to power this darn thing on or off i just keep pressing and pressing and nothing then sudden it works i dont think its broken or anything just really finicky with how it likes to be pressed not a deal breaker just a pain in the arse near system failure on update as is always the case with window there a crap load of update require right outta the gate asu even has a few of their own problem is once all the update were done it naturally want to reboot and it almost never turn back on i almost thought i was gonna have to call tech support because it look like the thing had flat out die it got stuck on a black screen for half an hour and wouldnt reboot so i had to repeatedly futz with that wonky power button and forced about half a dozen reboot which was a real pain to say the least after several glitchy reboot and jittery screen it did finally sputter back to life not sure what the issue was but it seem to be working fine now crappy charge port its got a micro usb charge port and a nice compact charger only problem is i really have to futz with it just to insert the charge cord it really doesnt go in very easily at all and is a real pain to work with huge design flaw line this is a fantastic little laptop hiccup and all i mean i wouldnt use this as my one and only computer but as a portable solution this is about as good as i imagine something like this could be love how it easily transform from a laptop to a tablet love window in this touchscreen environment and love the combination of portable and power this is the future of tablet and laptop right here and both android and ios have something to be seriously worried about the goliath is back in the room and its call microsoft and now with touchscreen laptop creep into the market theyre in prime position to keep their grasp on the market as far as the hiccup im sure asu will fix them over time but for now its not a total problem free experience overall this is a solid little laptop and minus the glitche it works as good as my budget toshiba win i laptop this is ideal for a life on the go be it travel work or fun im very impress with this little guy and excited to see where this is all go quite impressive even with the few glitche</li>

<li>3) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E2QY89W"" target=""_blank""><em>B00E2QY89W</em></a>: compact and portable cable i like the compact and easily portable size of the cable the retractable nature in theory should avoid the usual tangle issue of my other cords however i found myself get the cable tangle anyway and it was hard to find a good way to custom the cord to my desire length the cord is also on the short side so it will only work for short set ups</li>
<li>4) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CZ6WAEQ"" target=""_blank""><em>B00CZ6WAEQ</em></a>: compact widi device i like that the product is small and unassuming and good for travel if you need the product was easy to install which is good since i feel the norm has become a plug and play mentality and anything more might get me frustrate i was able to try it out on a samsung galaxy tablet and the picture quality look good i was able to pull up app and video finethe thing that isnt so plug and play is that with this device of course is that it has a very specific and limited list of compatible widi device there is a list of compatible product on the product page which lists basically new window laptop or windowsandroid phone so no mac product will work definitely make sure your device is on the list before purchase though</li>
<li>5) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009SYZ8OC"" target=""_blank""><em>B009SYZ8OC</em></a>: good length and strong cable my apple lightning cable just start to show sign of age with it charge only when the cable was not bent the amazonbasic cable is significant strong because it is a bit bulky i do like the length for this because the apple one included with the iphone is ridiculous short now im able to charge and sit on a couch or desk without reach the black color take some get use to especially with the usb insert into the charger but the usb and lightning cable fit solid and well into my device and everything charged finei did read other review about the cable being too big with a case on i have an amazonbasic case right now and it just fit for the one im use now but i can definitely see that it is than the apple one</li>
<li>6) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CD8ADKO"" target=""_blank""><em>B00CD8ADKO</em></a>: wellprice basic macbook case i finally downs from my inch macbook pro to a inch macbook air since i travel quite often and the pro weight was really weigh on my back so i was in need of a new case the amazonbasic one is definitely basic but there is something to be said about a simple and black case since it say it can fit both the pro and the air i knew that there would be more wiggle room housing the airin use my air it feel a bit loose so i was a bit worried at first but when zip up the fit seem snug enough and not enough to move around too much the extra room might be nice for including other thin things like papers mousepad or a screen clean cloth the inside lining is that mesh smooth feel so it wont scratchi like that the case is light so it doesnt add too much extra weight to the air when travel i dont know how well it would work in protect my air from drops or other forces but i dont see much of that happening compare to an iphone especially since i might only drop it during use and when its not in a case</li>
<li>7) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008R39DZK"" target=""_blank""><em>B008R39DZK</em></a>: looks great on the tv i have bought quite a few of these macbook tvmonitor cable over the years this one is one of the better one ive use the connection are solid and the look is clean with just a simple black and the ft length is a good length long enough to reach from the couch to the tvi dont know why the cable needs to be separate into two parts if the primary function of this product is for a mini displayport to hdmi i would rather have just one cord but maybe it has to be built that wayi set this up with the new macbook air and the resolution do show up as p on my tv and looks great on it stream video from the internet is fast and clean as well the audio works well with just a simple switch in the audio preference on my macbook</li>
<li>8) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BXF5FU6"" target=""_blank""><em>B00BXF5FU6</em></a>: beautiful design but slightly heavy there is so much to like about this ipad case for one its really stunning clean design neutral color i dont think my ipad has ever look betterthe feel of the material is really nice as well smooth than a leather but still has that subtle grip that is necessary the interior bubble padding doesnt have any sharp edge so it wont scratch the ipad and of course doubles as an extremely variable recline for the ipad my favorite part is that there a holder for a stylus i use a stylus a lot with my ipad and i havent try a case that has included one leading me to always clip it to one of the edge of the case itself the magnet work well and hold firm the ipad click in really easily to the case holder but still feel well supportedi will say that it do feel slightly heavy than average when i hold it in what domeo call its comfortable holding position it might also be because of the girth of the bubble padding so the wide and large grip make it feel heavy so those with small hand might have this issue i would say my hand are average as well when holding the ipad my natural hold is with the thumb placed on the edge and all the other finger cradle the back the ipad holder has quite a hard edge and couple with the weight of the ipad and the case it dug into my thumb quite a bit so it wasnt that comfortable</li>
<li>9) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009O7Y8ZI"" target=""_blank""><em>B009O7Y8ZI</em></a>: really tight fit for the iphone im use to use a velcro armband so this snap clip with adjust armband took some get use to the fit for the iphone was extremely tight and was tight even without a case on so i had to remove my case to use it as well the headphone jack hole is a bit funnily placed so i end up turning it the other way since i like my cord to be up instead of down when i the look and feel are good the fit when adjust to your needs work well the sweat didnt seem to get too much on the fabric but maybe a hot and more humid day would be more biggest problem is just have to take out my case every time i use it so would have like a loose fit</li>
<li>10) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009AR2MF0"" target=""_blank""><em>B009AR2MF0</em></a>: solid keyboard case could be much better i use this product with my ipad but it say it works with nd rd and th generation is a lot to like about this keyboard design nice key spacing easy on and off switch quick recharge battery good variety of shortcut key lock home search volume play cut etcthe case itself has a decent design and color combination though the problem are plenty just after minutes of setup and use the magnetic clasp is very flimsy and the magnetic clasp strength is weak on the other hand the magnetic clasp to the back is solid and nice to get it out of the way during use the keyboard has only two place to velcro when pick it up the ipad flop around because of the uneven weight distribution and lack of support the case doesnt allow for rotation and is always in landscape mode with the keyboard the keyboard is detach but no place to put it unless inside though i would worry about any scratch ill probably need to include a screen protector or cloth its not bulky with the keyboard inside thoughi dont mind this being my new primary case because of the keyboard but it will just take a few adjust and precaution for me to use and travel with my ipad</li>","Moshi Mythro In-Ear Earphones with Microphone, 3.5mm Headphone Jack, Wired Earbuds with HandyStrap, Gunmetal Gray",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715GfjC6woL._AC_SX466_.jpg,"<li>DR8 Neodymium drivers (15 Hz-20 kHz / -10dB@1kHz) in an anodized aluminum casing.

<li>5) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007HSKSP0"" target=""_blank""><em>B007HSKSP0</em></a>: good value for the money but beware of some quirk for setup benq led monitor is a fullhd x resolution monitor with builtin speaker and three input hdmi dvi and vga an optional audio jack is also available in combination with the vga input at the recommend fullhd resolution the picture is bright and sharp with decent but not great contrast keep in mind that this is a lowend inexpensive monitor you could buy other monitor with better pictures cost more than twice as much for the price i believe this is a very good value for the moneywhen i received the monitor i immediately set it up with and hdmi input there was no signal i said to myself another stupid monitor without auto hdmi detection then i pressed the menu button so that i can select the hdmi option menu button was dead too just as a last resort i reconnecte a vga cable and restarte the monitor this time everything work then i pressed the menu button again and the menu appear in the menu i first turn on the autodetect hdmi option then i also switch to the use hdmi option by default i think it is outright stupid that both of these option were turn off by the manufacturer worse yet there was no way to turn them back on without first connect to a computer use the vga input why do i need a computer connection to see the monitor menu on most other monitor this is not the case given that this is how it was for this monitor at least they should have made the autodetect hdmi option the default at the factory even if it is set to be on and if you do not connect a cable to the hdmi input the vga or dvi input will function just fine talk about being your own worst enemy benq definitely is i can easily believe that most of the small monitor and below will be use with a vga input but i expect that the overwhelming majority of monitor will use hdmi or possibly dvioverall i recommend the monitor highly if you are not look for the best possible picture but beware of the issue in the paragraph above if you need the highest quality picture buy a different brand but you will pay a lot more</li>

<li>6) <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0025VKUPM"" target=""_blank""><em>B0025VKUPM</em></a>: everything i had hope for and more i go to great length research anything fitness related before buy it be it a small item like a pair of compression arm sleeve or a k fullon triathlon bike the garmin xt was one product i particularly research thorough partly because of the list of features i want it to have and partly because there were just so many choice it was hard to decide on one watch i debate between this and the xt and finally chose the xt mainly because this was cheaperi want a watch that could of course chart map distance speed pace approx calorie but also have small features like notification of lap during a run strong gps user friendly software and allow copious statistics of my workout so that i can compare my workout over time i am an avid runner and bike and swim about once a week i found the most packed features in this the watch seem to be huge initially i was prepared for this thanks to the fellow reviewer who has post image of himself wearing the watch the watch was exactly what i expect after seeing those pictures that being said it is comfortable to wear and do not look or feel awkward at all it has two pin on the rubber strap that lock into the strap keeping the watch secure in place given the heavy of the watch there is no need to tie it tight on the wrist i keep it a notch loose and it stays perfectly in place doesnt rub against the skin yet is not so tight that it would leave its imprint on my wrist the benefit of the big screen is that it can display more information you can custom up to item to be visible on each screen this feature was one of the main reason i bought this watch i want to see distance speed current pace and average pace it is very useful now that i have this information available so readily on one strength i switch to this model after have use the garmin forerunner for a year primarily because i want more features which the xt had compare to the the xts speed of acquire satellite is remarkably fast it has probably never taken more than seconds even if i am indoors the on the other hand almost never picked up signal indoors and took much long when outdoors this is very helpful particularly in the winter month when i wont have to stand outside my house in the cold wait for the watch to acquire accuracy compare to the forerunner and my iphone with mapmyrun software this watch is very close in terms of distance speed and other such parameter i know a lot of people want this data to be accurate to a tee but ive realize that most device tend to fall within a narrow range and that tiny difference in distance can be due to a number of factor for example i typically run a m route sometimes ill see that as and sometimes as this small a difference in distance can be due to just the side of the road i was running on honestly too small a difference to be of a workout during a bike ride or a run the watch can be set to give notification at the end of each lap you can choose what you want that lap to be be it mile or mile the type of notification can also be modify between beep vibration or both if you have to stop say at a traffic light the watch automatic pause recording and resume within about seconds once you resume the activity you can view average pace and current pace as one of the many metric view on the watch in my experience the current pace in reality is your average pace for approximate the last seconds so dont let current pace throw you off if it seem too fast or too slow at any point of the watch do not come with a cadence sensor of its own i had really hope that this would come with its own metronome and cadence feature but it doesnt the xt come with all these fancy accessory but the cost add up to around an extra as for the xt it needs to be connected to a bike sensor separate yes this was a significant lacking feature for me but i have no choice but to wait till one become available at a more reasonable price hope the garmin folks are reading the watch come a bluetooth dongle ant this can be insert into the usb hub of your macpc and it will automatic fire up the garmin ant agent software and transfer all data from the xt you can choose which workout you want to transfer it also let you delete data on the watch once youve transfer you can do this if you want to free up memory space but after month of heavy use i still havent had the need to delete any data the bluetooth dongle is one of the very few things about the xt that i didnt quite like it is way too tiny and needs to be store careful so that it doesnt get lost black color doesnt really help either i have kept it in my drawer in the original clear plastic packet that it came in this packet has a large yellow color sticker on it so its easy to find in the drawer i am still nervous about lose this tiny the ant bluetooth dongle transfer data to your garmin account which can be access on the garmin connect website the data is copious and broken down in pretty much every way you could want particularly if youre a statistics junkie i was pleasant surprise at the level of detail this software has compare to mapmyrun i use to think that was pretty good too but garmin data is better and more detailed btw you can transfer all data from your garmin connect account to mapmyrun or mapmyride account as well you can login to your account there and choose the import workout option and then select garmin from the in water this was another important feature that steer me to this watch the watch hold up great under water ive use this both in open water and in a pool i agree with other reviewer that the route map under water is far from accurate but i really dont care about the map as much as i do about speed and distance and on these two parameter the watch perform greatbattery i believe the advertise battery life is hour i havent had the need to keep the watch on for this long just yet the longest i have use this at a stretch is hour and it work just fine one feature that i find strange is that the watch automatic turn on when charge and stays on so every time you remove the watch from the charge cable remember to turn it off if you wont be use it for some time strange feature but just take get use the watch has the standard garmin connect in their charger that connect points to the watch the forerunner had connect points which made it difficult to connect the xt has two connect which are slightly easy to connect that said i would still have like to see a standard microusb or a different type of connect that would have been easy to connect but i understand the need for a proprietary charge cable that tie us to garmin charge cable onlyall in all the xt is a phenomenal watch for triathlete or runner or cyclist look for all the features that are packed in this device</li>

living room wall and inch was an insane k compare to this sharp for price and size were major decide factor for mefor the most part the tv is a great choice the picture quality is great setting it up wireless was a breeze took no more than minutes connection to netflix is easy the remote has a dedicated netflix button that connect directly to netflix and i was able to mount it comfortable on the sanu mount that i had previous for my samsung inch tv it has plenty of hdmi and av port on the back to connect several device i have it set up through an av receiver so only the receiver connect to this tv and all other device run through the receiver when install note that the hdmi port are slightly set to the inside so before pressing the tv flat when mount remember to connect the hdmi cable first and then press the tv flat against the wall just a convenient mount havent bought the d glasses yet but i have read that you can use only sharp d glasses with this tv one neat feature is that it allow you to watch d but viewer can choose whether they want to watch in d no glasses or d with glasses not sure if ill be get d glasses there just doesnt seem to be a lot of d content to make the additional expenditure worthwhile just my personal great aspect is that the screen has a more matte finish to it which reflect a lot less light compare to my previous samsung tv which reflect a rainbow of colors if the lights were on in the room the fade reflection is more noticeable when the tvs are power off sharp score a point over samsung here when you first power this baby on you will definitely be blown away by the sheer awesome of this tv and the screen i think its the size that make it a phenomenal experience this is one device where size most definitely do are very average but then i doubt manufacturer these days focus much on the speaker or surround sound picture quality slim form factor and connective are what seem to be the focus for most manufacturer i have this connected to an external sound system so it is a nonissue for menow maybe im just being trivial or maybe i expect the absolute best at this price but the picture quality of this tv falls short of a samsung pictures feel just a little muted i guess soft would be the more appropriate term its still pretty good and im sure its a full p but its just not aswell sharp the samsung that i had early was also a hz same as this one so i know im compare apple to apple but the image on the samsung was far more crisp and rich i went crazy the first day try to adjust the picture quality thinking maybe i just had to set up correct but sadly the picture quality is still muted compare to the samsung maybe the matte finish screen is what is cause this its also possible that the inch screen size compare to my previous inch samsung is what is making the difference i havent been able to compare this with the inch samsung which would be the true this tv is great for what it is and the featurespicture qualityfunctional that it pack and i would recommend this highly if youre look for a inch tv but if samsung made this size in a reasonable price range even if it was a few hundred dollar more than the sharp i would buy that in a heartbeatupdate another reviewer has mention this issue and i have now experienced it three times in the last week the unit shut itself off and turn back on for no apparent reason no clue why this happen but if it continue it will be frustrate to say the least another issue i use a logitech universal remote and dont need to use the tv remote however every other week i get a message on the tv ask if i want to update the tv software i update the first time but then it happen again after a week if sharp is update software so often i have no interest update it each time i cant use the universal remote to make the dialogue box go away so i have to go into the closet to dig out the tv remote none of this has ever happen with the samsung that we have had for several years now if this continue i will have to disconnect it from the wireless network and use apple tv for netflix and online connective will be pointless have a wireless enable tv in this caseupdate i had bought this directly from amazon not a third party and saw no mention of a promotion on this tv at the time of purchase however i received an email last week that they had credit to my account as part of a hdtv promotion they had at time of purchase something you may want to look at when buy this tv always good to unexpected get cash every few week the tv show a software update notification i cant select yesno with the universal remote so i need to fetch the tv remote from the closet inconvenient to say the least cant figure out how to turn this software update notification off so that the message doesnt appear again any help would be much appreciate</li>
